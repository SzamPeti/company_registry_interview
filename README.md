# The hardest part of the project

Tried to implement that, when the user press on the submit button the application will wrap the data from the forms and send it. I look after it but it is so out my current knowledge than i decided to leave it out. If i could start over again than i know now how i need to build and structurise this project.

# How it's working

When every employees data ready, just press the Submit button and the database will be updated.
